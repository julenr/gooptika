              Try not to take your eyes for granted. They provide up to 16 hours of service every day of the year; so a 30 minute eye test at least every two years should be a celebration of the wonderful service they give you.
            </p>
            <p>
              However some people may need to be tested more often than every two years if they experience particular eye conditions or are over the age of 40. If in doubt, make an appointment and we’ll be happy to advise you.
            </p>
            <p>
              It can be a good idea to have the whole family tested at the same time, including the kids, as you’ll all benefit from being able to see clearer.

          <h4>Eye Diseases</h4>
        </div>
        <p>
          Eye diseases are quite rare although they become more common as we age. Many serious eye diseases have mild symptoms and the potential to cause serious damage if not identified and treated appropriately. Some people with serious eye diseases don’t realise they have a problem before significant and irreversible damage has occurred.

          Everyone should have a checkup from an optometrist or ophthalmologist every two years. Your optometrist may recommend more frequent checks if you’re at higher risk.

          If you suspect you have a eye disease contact us as soon as possible as early treatment can have a significant impact on the course of the disease.

          <h4>Vision & Ageing</h4>
        </div>
        <p>
          While your vision will change over time and especially in your 60s, you should not accept poor vision. Some people accept their eyesight will deteriorate with age and that nothing can be done to improve their vision, but this is untrue. A variety of lenses exist for improving vision at all stages of life.

          Furthermore, at 60 the risk of serious eye diseases is elevated. Diseases like glaucoma can cause serious loss of vision and even blindness. Among over 60s, poor eyesight decreases mobility and increases the risk of depression.

          The best way to prevent serious deterioration of vision is early detection and treatment. Your optometrist can even detect disease before you experience symptoms.

          <h4>Eye Conditions</h4>
        </div>
        <p>
          Many people experience vision problems are a result of eye conditions. The four main eye conditions are very common and vision can easily be corrected with glasses or contact lenses. It is important to note that your vision changes through your lifetime and while some eye conditions are hereditary others can develop as a result of your lifestyle, health and the natural process of ageing.
          Eye conditions are the result of refractive errors. For perfectly clear vision, the image of a viewed object is focused onto the retina at the back of your eye. The lens, as well as other parts of your eye, refracts light onto the retina like a camera refracts light onto film. If the image is not focused exactly on the retina then the image will be blurred just like an out-of-focus photograph.

          <h4>Nutrition</h4>
        </div>
        <p>
          Good nutrition is important for health and eye health is no exception. There’s the old maxim about carrots being good for your eyes! (They are in fact!) But your eyes can benefit from you eating a balanced diet. A variety of foods (including carrots) contain antioxidants which are good for your eye health.
          Sometimes vision problems can be a result of dietary deficiencies but nutritional supplements should only be taken in consultation with your optometrist or health professional.
